    I would credit Boxing as one of the things that changed the trajectory of my life. I was not an A student by anymeans. I almost had to repeat my senior year because I was truant.<br>
    Like many students I felt uninterested and disengaged. Had it not been for boxing I may have never pursued higher education. Boxing gave me the opportunity at a full ride<br>
    scholarship to a small school in Michigan's upper peninsula. Northern Michigan is home to the USOEC. United States Olympic Education Center.<br>
